The mixed use of app router and pages router is uncommon, but Nextra only supports the pages router. However, the project originally uses the app router, what should I do?
This article briefly describes how to use Nextra, as well as the mixed use of app router and pages router.

You only need to add a pages folder to the project root directory. Now you have both the app folder and the pages folder. Next, you need to consider how to switch between pages.

if you use github Actions to build and deploy your application, as it is a next project,so you may choose next Configure template
first you should comment the block below

```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
  # with:
    # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable
    # server side image optimization (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized).
    #
    # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
    # static_site_generator: next  should comment the property
    #  enablement: false
```
at your next.config.mjs, you should add a property,just like below,the basePath is your repository name

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    basePath:'/colin',
    output: "export",
    trailingSlash: true,
    images: {
        unoptimized: true
    }
};
```

at pages directory,you can add the _meta.json file,In my example, the content result is as follows.
The directory structure is roughly divided into four main categories, namely front_end, python, other, and about. The final navigation address is the IP + directory name + file name.

```json
{
  "front-end": "frontend",
  "python": "Python",
  "other": "Other",
  "about": "About"
}
```

With the above content, it can ensure that the CI/CD process runs normally and the page structure renders correctly, but the Nextra documentation page navigation does not work. Therefore, it is necessary to add the configuration item navs in theme.config.jsx.

```javascript
export default {
    navs: [
        {
            title: 'app router and pages router',
            url: '/front-end/1',
        },
    ],
}
```

url represents the access path
